# Tense and Time Spans

This repository contains jupyter notebooks related to my research on verbal tense/aspect in Biblical Hebrew. 

The primary question addressed by these notebooks is:<br>
**Do explicit time markers affect the distribution of verbal tense within Biblical Hebrew clause chains?**

"explicit time marker" refers to a phrase that provides time reference at the clause level.

"clause chains" refers to the tree-like discourse structure as analyzed and recorded in the ETCBC database.

"distribution of verbal tense" refers to the kinds of verbal tenses that are selected throughout a clause chain. A supposition for this part of the research question is that clause atoms at the top of the discourse structure can pass on their clause-level time references to their daughters. That supposition must also be demonstrated by the data.
