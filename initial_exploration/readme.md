# Initial Exploration

The notebooks and processed data in this notebook were created during the initial phrase of data discovery. There is a simple dataset, `data/time_spans.pickle`, which is produced progressively throughout these notebooks. These notebooks found some basic correlation between verb tense and time markers. For instance, time indicators which start with ל are used alongside the yiqtol 50% of the time, whereas all other verb representations are distributed rather evenly (see `3_markers_with_prepositions.ipynb`). Some time markers, like לעולם, are used even more exclusively with the yiqtol verb (60%, see 1_exploration_and_data.ipynb`).


Other insights were important on a more basic level. For instance, what kinds of word combinations constitute "time markers" in the ETCBC data? 73% contain a preposition (`2_markers_with_prepositions.ipynb`). Many contain יום + various adverbial specifications (including prepositions) (`1_exploration_and_data.ipynb`). Many contain numeric indications of a time unit, such as a number of days or years. Some time markers are deictic (context-dependent), especially markers that are dependent on the time of speaking (עתה, אז, מחר). 


The possibility of categorizing certain substantives based on formal criteria is an interesting research question; it would allow such classifications to be combined with prepositional classifications—and from there to construct a fuller picture of a given time phrase. Terms like יום, שנה, ירח constitute nouns with a lexical/semantic content that explicitly indicate time. What formal characteristics separate these noun forms from other forms of nouns? For example, in contrast to the term לחם, a יום would not normally be eaten; nor would it be given (נתן)—although, such constructions are conceptually possible in the case of metaphorical language. In those cases, though, a metaphor might be detectable by comparing the normal use of the word against the edge case (i.e., days are not usually eaten, but in this case it is; it could be a metaphor!). The issues outlined here present potential pathways for further exploration.


For further consideration: what other kinds of criteria might separate temporal substantives from others?
