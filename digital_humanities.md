# Reflections on Articles from Terras 2013, *Defining Digital Humanities*

## Unsworth, "What is humanities Computing and What is Not?"

In this article, Unsworth reflects on six key characteristics of digital humanities in relation to philosophical and methodological considerations. I found the article insightful and agreed with the arguments. Two specific points stood out. 

First, Unsworth describes the field of "humanities  computing" as a "surrogate" of its object of study. The tools of digital humanities model the very texts its researchers are studying. In this way, Unworth says, digital humanists are more self-conscious that the products of their research are approximations. He compares it against traditional products of research such as articles and books.

Unsworth's remarks shed light on the value of digital humanities in Biblical Studies. Digital research takes attention away from the wit and skill of the researcher (their ability to cleverly translate, interpret, or memorize) and places it more transparently on a depiction of the data itself. Not only does this democratize the research, it also prevents scholars from hiding behind edifices of "skill."

Second, and similar to the previous observation, Unsworth comments on the "formal expression" that digital humanities brings to the research. Encoding a conclusion into formal code forces the researcher to reflect on the methodology behind their analysis. They must express their conclusions in rules. 

In Biblical Studies, where previous methods allowed for subtle leaps of logic toward the conclusion, Digital Biblical Studies encodes the analysis and allows the conclusions to be reproduced, challenged, or improved. This difference is not merely a matter of better tools—it is a complete refitting of the Biblical Scholar's task. 

For my research on the Hebrew Verb and Time Phrases, I am encoding my arguments. It is, as Unsworth calls it, a "way of reasoning." It is "thought" exposed and displayed. And since the reasoning is immediately accessible by anyone, it can be built upon, improved, or critiqued.

## Flanders, "The productive Unease of 21st-century Digital Scholarship."

Flanders' article focuses on the disjoint between excitement over advances in digital technology and anxiety about the challenges they pose to the traditional infrastructure. This article is well-written and greatly relevant for Digital Biblical Studies. 

I will comment on two of her points. First, Flanders discusses the angst over older infrastructures of scholarly interaction. That issue is especially relevant to Digital Biblical Studies, where scholars tend to assume that a work is unquestionably reliable if it has a major publisher's name on it. The shortcomings of this closed and commercial system should be exposed by showing the capabilities of newer resources. Similarly, concerns over the reliability of such tools (Flanders' second relevant point) will disappear once biblical scholars stop seeing the research as reputation-based (i.e. this name over that) and start seeing it from the perspective of reproducible, open science.

By regularly uploading my work to github and making efforts to carefully annotate it, I hope that I can help bring about the change outlined above.

## Forster, "I’m Chris, Where am I Wrong?"

Forster's article is a reprint of a blog post in which he addresses the definition of digital humanities. He mainly focuses on groups of people: those focused on practical tasks, "New Media folks" who focus on the digital medium itself, and those who utilize digital tools in the classroom. The article is written from a humorous, self-deprecating perspective (which is itself is done with irony). 

Chris's article is short and not intended to simply be an information source (it is also part entertainment). But I did learn one thing from it: that people who focus on "new media" would also consider themselves under the branch of "digital humanities." I have not thought as much about the broader boundaries that digital humanities can encompass.
